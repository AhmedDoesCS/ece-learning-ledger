# ⚠️ Archived Project
This project represents an early exploration of full-stack development and database-driven applications.

Key learnings from this project directly informed the design of my current project:
[New Project Name] — an assistive learning tool for cognitive development.

# ECE Learning Ledger

A database-backed web application designed to help ECE students
structure and reflect on their learning of circuits, components,
and concepts over time.

## Motivation
This project was built to formalize how an engineering student
captures intuition, mistakes, and conceptual understanding while
learning circuitry.

## Tech Stack
- MySQL
- Node.js (Express)
- React (Vite + Tailwind)

## Status
🚧 In active development
